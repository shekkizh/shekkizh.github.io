Hi,
I'm Sarath, a Ph.D. candidate in Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Southern California. My research advisor is [Prof. Antonio Ortega](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Ortega/Antonio).

I'm broadly interested in graphs and machine learning. 
Currently, I focus on non parametric, neighborhood algorithms for understanding data and deep learning models. 
<!-- An overaching theme that has been driving my research is the need for high performing, extremely simple and explainable systems. -->

## Background 
Prior to joing USC for my PhD, I worked as a software engineer for 2.5 years at KLA-Tencor's Wafer Inspection Division on a defect classification software.

I obtained my Masters degree with specialization in computer vision and machine learning from USC. During my study, I had the opportunity to work as part of the computer vision research group at USC Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Systems where I was advised by Dr. Jongmoo Choi under the guidance of Prof. Gerard Medioni.  I was also a part time software developer at Laboratory of Neurological Imaging where I worked on project Informatics Visualization in NeuroImaging (INVIZIAN) lead by Prof. John Van Horn. 

I completed my Bachelors degree in Electronics and Communication from National Institute of Technology - Tiruchrappalli, where I worked under the advise of Profs. Deivalakshmi and Palanisamy.
