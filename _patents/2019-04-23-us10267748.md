Methods and systems for training an inspection-related algorithm are provided. One system includes one or more computer subsystems configured for performing an initial training of an inspection-related algorithm with a labeled set of defects thereby generating an initial version of the inspection-related algorithm and applying the initial version of the inspection-related algorithm to an unlabeled set of defects.
