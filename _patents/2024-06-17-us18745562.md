abstract: 'Techniques are described herein for a method of decreasing the likelihood of out-of-domain LLM responses. The method includes determining, by a block of a LLM, a representation of the text input. The method further includes determining a set of coefficients based at least on a reconstruction of the text input using a dictionary and the representation of the text input. The method further includes performing a sparsity check using the set of coefficients. The method further includes generating a response to the text input based at least on the sparsity check.'
