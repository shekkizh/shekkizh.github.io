Hi,
I'm Sarath, a staff scientist at Salesforce. I became part of the Salesforce family through an acquisition, [Tenyx](https://www.tenyx.com/), where I was a research/founding member building key technologies in LLM training, safety, and alignment.

Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. from the Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Southern California, where I worked with [Prof. Antonio Ortega](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Ortega/Antonio).
During my Ph.D., I focused on non-parametric, neighborhood/graph algorithms for understanding data and machine learning models.
For more details, check out my [Thesis](https://digitallibrary.usc.edu/asset-management/2A3BF1MSNP2CJ), [Defense Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yjkLvJgQCnnMuI0PfB6yVLEJGejN3JpMqUIqAUMKTuM/edit?usp=sharing).

<!-- Read about one research direction I'm currently pursuing [here](/files/Research_proposal_Sarath_Shekkizhar.pdf).
I'm in the job market for a research/postdoctoral position. Please send me an email if you think I'll be a good fit - I would be happy to discuss my research and aspirations. [[Research Statement](/files/Research_Statement.pdf)] -->

Want to connect, collaborate, or chat about grad school, research, etc.? Schedule a meeting here: [Google Meet](https://calendar.app.google/VXEYajKQhJbhwspZ6){: .btn .btn--info}

<!-- An overarching theme that has been driving my research is the need for high-performing, extremely simple, and explainable systems. -->

## Background

Prior to joining USC for my Ph.D., I worked on defect classification software for 2.5 years at KLA-Tencor's Wafer Inspection Division as a software engineer.

I obtained my Master's degree with a specialization in computer vision and machine learning from USC. During my study, I had the opportunity to work as part of the computer vision research group at USC Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Systems, where I was advised by Dr. Jongmoo Choi under the guidance of Prof. Gerard Medioni. I was also a part-time software developer at the Laboratory of Neurological Imaging, where I worked on the project Informatics Visualization in NeuroImaging (INVIZIAN) led by Prof. John Van Horn.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication from the National Institute of Technology - Tiruchirappalli, where I worked under the advice of Prof. Deivalakshmi and Palanisamy.
