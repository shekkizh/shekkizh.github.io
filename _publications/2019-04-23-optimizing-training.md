excerpt: 'Methods and systems for training an inspection-related algorithm are provided. One system includes one or more computer subsystems configured for performing an initial training of an inspection-related algorithm with a labeled set of defects thereby generating an initial version of the inspection-related algorithm and applying the initial version of the inspection-related algorithm to an unlabeled set of defects.'

Methods and systems for training an inspection-related algorithm are provided. One system includes one or more computer subsystems configured for performing an initial training of an inspection-related algorithm with a labeled set of defects thereby generating an initial version of the inspection-related algorithm and applying the initial version of the inspection-related algorithm to an unlabeled set of defects. The computer subsystem(s) are also configured for altering the labeled set of defects based on results of the applying. The computer subsystem(s) may then iteratively re-train the inspection-related algorithm and alter the labeled set of defects until one or more differences between results produced by a most recent version and a previous version of the algorithm meet one or more criteria. When the one or more differences meet the one or more criteria, the most recent version of the inspection-related algorithm is outputted as the trained algorithm.
