Hi,
I'm Sarath, a PhD student in Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Southern California, Los Angeles. My research advisor is [Prof. Antonio Ortega](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Ortega/Antonio)

I'm broadly interested in graphs and machine learning. 
Currently, I focus on non parametric, neighborhood algorithms for understanding data and deep learning models. 
<!-- An overaching theme that has been driving my research is the need for high performing, extremely simple and explainable systems. -->

## What's New

## Background 
Prior to joing USC for my PhD, I worked as a Software Engineer for 2.5 years at KLA-Tencor's Wafer Inspection Division on a defect classification software.

I obtained my Master's degree with specialization in Computer Vision/ Machine Learning from USC. During my study, I had the opportunity to research as part of the Computer Vision Research group at USC Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Systems where I was advised by Dr. Jongmoo Choi under the guidance of Prof. Gerard Medioni.  I was also a part time software developer at Laboratory of Neurological Imaging where I worked on project Informatics Visualization in NeuroImaging (INVIZIAN) lead by Prof. John Van Horn. 

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication from National Institute of Technology, Tiruchrappalli (aka Regional Engineering College, Trichy) where I worked under the advise of Prof. Deivalakshmi and Prof. Palanisamy.
